# ScintiSpecChromatog
Scintispec script for 2, 3 or 4 chromatography strips or SEP-PAK cartridges.

## Downloading and usage
Download the files in this repository and place them in the CONFIG directory of the Scintispec installation. Scintipspec is very fussy about the wpb file; each line must be 128 characters long. After downloading the files open Chromatography.wpb in the Scintispec batch file editor and it will save the file with the correct number of characters per line.
